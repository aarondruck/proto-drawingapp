Mobile app creation tool - Creating a mobile musical instrument prototype

//////////////////////////////

The Pitch:
Users can create mobile apps from their phone, instead of a desktop.  The point is to create quick, fast ad/hoc apps to share with your friends, maybe in a party setting.

The idea is you can create apps, not by coding, but just by doing a series of if/then statements with specific ingredients for the app, similar to IFTTT.  Apps have dynamic content and interactions that are specific to the user.  Each person will see different content and use it in a different way.

There's only one app flow that works so far.  Here are the instructions:
- Select Instrument
- Draw your instrument, hit Save then Next
- Select a sound and hit Next
- Press the image to hear the sound.  Then hit Publish, to create the app.  There should be a link to your app.  Press the image in the app to hear the sound.

Note: It's buggy right now, and only the Instrument list item works.  Basically you can draw a musical instrument, add a sound, publish the app, and then share the app with friends to make a band right there on the spot.

Testing: This has only been testing on iPhone and iOS Simulator.

Design Goals:
- people want customized, personalized apps
- apps (vs a website) have dynamic content, that is personalized to the user
- the end product for these are contextual, local, one-off, adhoc, impromptu/throw-away apps
- the app creation can either guide by a template structure (guides for all the App Store categories eg. Games, Books, Business, etc.) or it's completely open-ended, possibly with 1 input and 1 output (similar to https://ifttt.com/wtf and http://www.atooma.com/welcome)
- I'm generally more aligned with philosophies similar to Bret Victor re: content creation for mobile, in that it should use mobile features/affordances to create rather than using QUERTY coding used for desktop
